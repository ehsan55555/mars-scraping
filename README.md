# Mars Temperature Data Scraping and Analysis

## This repository contains code for scraping and analyzing Mars  data from a couple specific website. The code uses web scraping techniques to extract data and then performs analysis and visualization on the collected data. Below, you'll find an overview of the repository's contents and instructions for using the provided code.


# Repository Structure

##  - Starter_Code:
   
    This folder contains two unsolved Jupyter Notebook files:
   
    - part_1_mars_news_starter.ipynb
    - part_2_mars_weather_starter.ipynb
    These notebooks serve as starting points for the Mars news and weather data analysis.


## - Solutions:
    
    This folder contains two solved Jupyter Notebook files:
   
    - part_1_mars_news_solution.ipynb
    - part_2_mars_weather_solution.ipynb
    - mars.csv
    
    These notebooks provide the solutions to the Mars news and weather data analysis.

  
  - README.md:
  
  This document, providing an overview of the repository and instructions.


## Contents and Purpose
 
  - Starter_Code and Solutions:
    
    These folders contain Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate the process of analyzing Mars news and weather data. The "Starter_Code" notebooks provide unsolved versions for users to attempt, while the "Solutions" notebooks offer solved versions for reference.


## Additional Information
  
  - Data Scraping and Analysis Notebook:
    Part 1 - Mars News Analysis:
    
    The notebook "part_1_mars_news_solution.ipynb" focuses on extracting news data related to Mars. It demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to automate the process of collecting news article titles and preview texts from a specific website


## Key Concepts and Steps:

  - The notebook showcases the utilization of Beautiful Soup for extracting data from HTML content.
  - Pandas is employed to transform and clean the extracted data, resulting in a structured Pandas DataFrame.
  - The code walks through basic data analysis techniques, providing insights into the extracted temperature data.
  - Matplotlib is used for creating simple data visualizations, enhancing the understanding of Mars temperature trends.
