  - README.md:
  This document, providing an overview of the repository and instructions.

## Contents and Purpose
  - Starter_Code and Solutions:
    These folders contain Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate the process of analyzing Mars news and weather data. The "Starter_Code" notebooks provide unsolved versions for users to attempt, while the "Solutions" notebooks offer solved versions for reference.


## Additional Information
  - Data Scraping and Analysis Notebook:
    The notebook "part_2_mars_weather_solution.ipynb" in the root directory focuses on extracting and analyzing temperature data from a specific Mars temperature data site. It guides users through the process of web scraping using Beautiful Soup, data manipulation and analysis using Pandas, and data visualization using Matplotlib.

## Key Concepts and Steps:

  - The notebook showcases the utilization of Beautiful Soup for extracting data from HTML content.
  - Pandas is employed to transform and clean the extracted data, resulting in a structured Pandas DataFrame.
  - The code walks through basic data analysis techniques, providing insights into the extracted temperature data.
  - Matplotlib is used for creating simple data visualizations, enhancing the understanding of Mars temperature trends.
